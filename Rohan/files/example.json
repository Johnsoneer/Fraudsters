As a small, grass roots organization, we focus primarily on prevention and protection which begins with shelter and continues with education, so those vulnerable are aware of the dangers and able to protect themselves.</p>\r\n<p>DREAM Project Foundation was officially founded in 2011 to support the DREAM House children's home based in Thailand on the border of Myanar (Burma). While helping children stay safe from the trafficing is the heart of our mission, we know that in order to end trafficking it must be a collaborative effort for all people and communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We at DREAM Project Foundation are determined to fight against this atrocity, focusing on the factors that cause people to be vulnerable targets to traffickers, with most of our work based in SE Asia as it is a major international hub of human trafficking.</p>", "object_id": 5558108, "venue_longitude": -85.6706147, "venue_country": "US", "previous_payouts": [{"name": "", "created": "2013-04-19 03:25:42", "country": "US", "state": "", "amount": 500.0, "address": "", "zip_code": "", "event": 5558108, "uid": 52778636}], "sale_duration": 22.0, "num_payouts": 0, "name": "DREAM Project Foundation - Taste of a Better Future", "country": "US", "delivery_method": 0.0, "has_analytics": 0, "fb_published": 0, "venue_state": "MI", "has_header": null, "show_map": 1 }
